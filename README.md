# IBM_Python_Coursera_ML

## This ML project is split into two sections:
- The first is a guided exploration of the data, i.e., data visualization, feature selection, and pre-processing
- The second portion deals with running through the perams to find the optimum and then applying that optimum to achieve the best prediction score

## The following algorithms are used:
    K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
    Decision Tree
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Logistic Regression

#### The scores measured are Jaccard, F1-Score, and LogLoss (only for logistic regression)
